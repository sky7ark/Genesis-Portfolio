        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate with a Master’s in Applied Science in Computer
          Engineering, passionate about artificial intelligence, machine
          learning, and web technologies. My experience as an AI Teaching
          Assistant allowed me to mentor students, address technical queries,
          and organize workshops, sharpening my communication and technical
          skills in my bachelor's degree life. Additionally, I worked as an IT
          Executive, where I managed website maintenance and collaborated with a
          team to resolve technical issues, enhancing my problem-solving and
          teamwork abilities. I am excited by Genesis’s mission to foster
          innovation and empower startups. I look forward to contributing my
          skills to cutting-edge AI projects while growing as part of an
          inclusive and dynamic team in Newfoundland and Labrador.

            <p>
              The main theme is detecting the eye-diseases from the symptoms.
              The purpose of this project is to aware people about their eye
              problems. With that primary eye disease detection system, they can
              know about their problems and take initial steps rather than just
              sit in their house without any knowledge about their diseases.
              Awareness about the eye diseases and taking initial steps after
              knowing the problem from the system.

            <p>
              We were 3 teammates in this group and my part was implementing the
              algorithms and analysis which one is best for the detection. It
              was a very amazing time i worked with them.

              Navigating Heart Disease: Insights and Analysis for Improved
              Diagnosis
            </h3>
            <p>
              The project "Navigating Heart Disease: Insights and Analysis for
              Improved Diagnosis" aims to comprehensively analyze a heart
              disease dataset to identify key insights that can improve
              diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies. Initially, the
              necessary libraries and dataset are imported to set up the
              analysis. The first and last few rows of the dataset are inspected
              to understand its structure and contents. The dataset's
              dimensions, including the number of rows and columns, are
              determined, and detailed information regarding data types and
              memory requirements is gathered.

              It was my single project in my Advanced Computing Concepts Lab.

            <p>
              After learning the time series analysis, i tried to make a project
              to know more about it. Actually this project is still running and
              i still working on it. i have learned lots of things throughout
              this project. For example: plots, baseline model, ARIMA, auto
              correlation chart and so on. i am really enjoying making this
              project.
